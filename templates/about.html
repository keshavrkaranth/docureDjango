							but the chemicals retained
							during such processes even if below the permissible limit as per FSSAI norms, get
							accumulated
							over a period of time in our body, can pose various health threats including many chronic
							health
							situations metabolic syndromes like Diabetes, Hyper tension, Thyroid Disorders, even Cancer.

				<h3><strong>WHY NATURAL, UNPROCESSED FOOD?</strong></h3>
				<div class="kes">
					<ul>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">To improve overall well-being, let’s first understand the
							concept of “wholefoods” versus
							“fragmented” or processed foods.</li><br>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">Processed foods have been stripped of one or more of their
							original elements, i.e. they are
							missing valuable nutrients, fibres or water.</li><br>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">Natural foods, or whole foods (whole grains, seeds, nuts, beans
							and legumes) have been
							provided
							for us by nature. They are the perfect foods for our body for healthy living.</li><br>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">Whilst we can certainly exist on processed foods, we cannot
							survive on these foods alone.
						</li><br>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">Man-made/factory-made processed foods, which have been highly
							sugared, salted and processed,
							are
							devoid of so many of the nutrients and life-giving nutrients for optimal health.</li><br>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">Consumption of highly processed foods and white flour-based
							products having a high glycemic
							index and glycemic load, leads to accumulation of body fat and weight gain, and causes many
							chronic diseases.</li><br>
						<li style="list-style: inside;">Doesn’t it make sense to move toward nature and simply eat
							natural foods</li><br>
